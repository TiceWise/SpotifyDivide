        <H4>About</H4>
        <p>I save new music on Spotify by liking songs. I listen to Discover Weekly,
            Release Radar, and a number of other favourite playlists, and just <i class="far fa-heart"></i> everything i like.
        </p>
        <p>I do have a lot of personal playlists too, for different genres and moods for example.
            It’s how I collect music. However, I never got around to divide my liked songs over these playlists. It was
            just too much hassle, dragging and dropping each song to multiple playlists, sometimes 100+ songs. In
            addition, I wanted more information on the songs, like genre and bpm.</p>
        <p>That’s why I created SpoDivide.</p>
        <H4 class="mt-4">More details on use</H4>
        <H5>Step 1</H5>
        <p>Step 1 is pretty straight forward: Select the playlist from which you want to divide
            your songs. Often this will be your Liked Songs, but you can also select any other playlist from which you
            want to divide songs. For example Discover Weekly or Release Radar, or any other playlist that contains many
            songs you want to add to your own playlists.</p>
        <H5>Step 2</H5>
        <p>This is an extra step to make your life easier in step 3. If you have a lot of
            playlists (like me), you probably don't want to add songs to most of them. Step 2 is a pre-selection for
            playlists that are available in Step 3. Of course you're free to use all of your playlists with 'Select
            all'!
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that your playlists are already filtered. For SpoDivide to be able to add songs to a playlist, the
            playlist must be created by you (you must be the owner) and playlist can't be a collaborative playlist.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another use case of SpoDivide is creating a playlist for a special occasion: Create a playlist in Spotify,
            Select it as target, and just go through your Liked Songs; Add the songs you want to add for the occasion,
            and simply skip the others.
        </p>
        <H5>Step 3</H5>
        <p>From left to right, top to bottom, we see:

            <li>information of the track,</li>

            <ul>
                <li>The buttons with confirm peform the action selected below on this song to the
                    playlist(s) selected below.</li>
                <li>The buttons without confirmation are used for navigation (next or previous song)
                    without performing any action.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>the action you want to perform (move, copy or remove)</li>
            <ol type="a">
                <li><b>Move</b> adds the song to the selected
                    playlist(s) and deletes the song from source playlist, or 'Unlikes' the song if the source
                    playlist you selected in Step 1 is your Liked Songs.</li>
                <li><b>Copy</b> adds the song to the selected playlist(s) and doesn't remove the song from the source
                    playlist.</li>
                <li><b>Remove</b> only deletes from source playlists without adding it to a playlist (for if you just
                    don't like the
                    song anymore).</li>
            </ol>
            <ul>
                <li>Note that for the Copy and Remove action, you must be the owner of the source playlist and
                    the source playlist can't be a collaborative playlists. In that case the Copy and Remove option are
                    automatically hidden.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>and the list to select the playlists to which you want to add the song.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <H5>What does each audio feature mean?</H5>
        <ul>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Popularity</b> is calculated by an algorithm and is based, in the most part, on the total number
                    of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are.</li>
                <li><b>Energy</b> represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks
                    feel fast, loud, and noisy. </li>
                <li><b>Danceability</b> describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical
                    elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity.</li>
                <li><b>Valence</b> describes the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. </li>
                <li><b>Speechiness</b> detects the presence of spoken words in a track.</li>
                <li><b>Acousticness</b> shows the confidence measure whether the track is acoustic. A higher number
                    represents a high confidence the track is acoustic.</li>
                <li><b>Instrumentalness</b> predicts whether a track contains no vocals. The higher the instrumentalness
                    value is, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content.</li>
                <li><b>Liveness detects</b> the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values
                    represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. </li>
